## 3. Generative AI: Capabilities and Challenges

Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning that can create **new content** (text, images, code, music) without necessarily needing retraining or fine-tuning.

### Capabilities:
*   **Content Creation:** Stories, videos, music.
*   **Conversational AI:** Advanced chatbots and virtual assistants.
*   **Code Generation:** Writing boilerplate or complete functions.

### Challenges:
*   **Hallucinations:** The model generating factually incorrect but confident-sounding information.
*   **Safety & Bias:** Potential for generating harmful or biased content.
*   **Latency:** The time required to generate long-form content.
*   **Cost:** High computational requirements for large foundation models.

## 4. Selecting and Measuring GenAI Models

### Factors for Model Selection:
*   **Model Types:** Optimizing for the specific task (e.g., text, image, code).
*   **Performance Requirements:** Assessing accuracy and the reliability of the output for the target task.
*   **Constraints:**
    *   **Computational Resources:** Available GPU/CPU and memory.
    *   **Data Availability:** Size and quality of available training data.
    *   **Deployment Requirements:** On-premises vs. Cloud requirements.
*   **Compliance:** Moral concerns, fairness, transparency (traceability), and accountability, especially in regulated industries (Healthcare, Finance).
*   **Cost vs. Capability:** 
    *   **Large Models:** More precise but expensive and slow.
    *   **Small Models:** Faster and cheaper with more deployment flexibility.

### Business Metrics for GenAI:
Organizations measure the success of AI initiatives by their tangible impact on business objectives:
